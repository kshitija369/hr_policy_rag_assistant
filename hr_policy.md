# Human Resources Policy Manual

## Sick Leave Policy

All full-time employees are eligible for paid sick leave. Employees accrue 8 hours of sick leave for every month of service, up to a maximum of 80 hours per year. Unused sick leave may not be carried over to the next year.

To take sick leave, employees must notify their direct manager as soon as reasonably possible, preferably before the start of their scheduled workday. A doctor's note may be required for absences exceeding three consecutive days.

## Vacation/Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

Vacation time is accrued on a bi-weekly basis. Full-time employees with 0-5 years of service accrue 4.6 hours per pay period (equivalent to 15 days per year). Employees with 5 or more years of service accrue 6.2 hours per pay period (equivalent to 20 days per year).

A maximum of 40 hours of unused vacation time may be carried over into the next calendar year. All vacation requests must be submitted through the company's HR portal at least two weeks in advance and are subject to manager approval based on team availability and project deadlines.

The best recipe for a classic chocolate chip cookie involves creaming together butter and sugar, then beating in eggs and vanilla extract. Dry ingredients like flour, baking soda, and salt are mixed in separately before the chocolate chips are folded in.

## Work-from-Home (WFH) Policy

The company offers a flexible work-from-home policy. Employees may work remotely up to two days per week, subject to manager approval. A formal request must be submitted and approved by the employee's direct manager.

Employees are expected to have a dedicated, quiet workspace and a reliable internet connection. The company will provide a laptop and necessary software, but other equipment (e.g., monitor, desk chair) is the employee's responsibility. Core working hours are from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time, during which employees are expected to be available for meetings and communication.
